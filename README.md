MovieLens Project Instructions
The submission for the MovieLens project will be three files: a report in the form of an Rmd file, a report in the form of a PDF document knit from your Rmd file, and an R script that generates your predicted movie ratings and calculates RMSE. The R script should contain all of the code and comments for your project. Your grade for the project will be based on two factors:

Your report and script (75%)
The RMSE returned by testing your algorithm on the validation set (the final hold-out test set) (25%)
Note that to receive full marks on this project, you may not simply copy code from other courses in the course series and be done with your analysis. Your work on this project needs to build on code that is already provided.

Please note that once you submit your project, you will not be able to make changes to your submission.

Report and Script (75%)
Your report and script will be graded by your peers, based on a rubric defined by the course staff. Each submission will be graded by three peers and the median grade will be awarded. To receive your grade, you must review and grade the submissions of five of your fellow learners after submitting your own. This will give you the chance to learn from your peers.

Please pay attention to the due dates listed! The project submission is due before the end of the course to allow time for peer grading. Also note that you must grade the reports of your peers by the course close date in order to receive your grade.

RMSE (25%)
Your movie rating predictions will be compared to the true ratings in the validation set (the final hold-out test set) using RMSE. Be sure that your report includes the RMSE and that your R script outputs the RMSE.

Note that to receive full marks on this project, you may not simply copy code from other courses in the course series and be done with your analysis. Your work on this project needs to build on code that is already provided.

IMPORTANT: Make sure you do NOT use the validation set (the final hold-out test set) to train your algorithm. The the final hold-out test set should ONLY be used to test your final algorithm. The final hold-out test set should only be used at the end of your project with your final model. It may not be used to test the RMSE of multiple models during model development. You should split the edx data into a training and test set or use cross-validation.

Honor Code
You are welcome to discuss your project with others, but all submitted work must be your own. Your participation in this course is governed by the terms of the edX Honor Code. If your project is found to violate the terms of the honor code, you will receive a zero on the project, may be unenrolled from the course, and will be ineligible for a certificate.

Project Due Date
Submissions for the Movielens project are due one week before course close, on March 9, 2022, at 23:59 UTC. This allows time for peer grading to occur! Peer grades are due at course close, on March 16, 2022, at 23:59 UTC.

Peer Feedback
You are strongly encouraged to give your peers thoughtful, specific written feedback in addition to the numerical grades in the rubic. Think about the type of feedback that would help you improve your work and offer that type of feedback to your fellow learners.

If you feel your report was not fairly graded by your peers, you may report it in the discussion forum to ask for staff review of the report.
